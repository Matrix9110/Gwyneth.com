    <p id="page">Greetings, my name is Gwyneth herrera, as you may know! And I adore "Coding." It's a passion and a curse<br><br> a passion because I love the excitement of designing a website that nobody has created already! <br>it can provide you several opportunities in life. I'm up for the test!!!<br><br>and a curse because it's so stressful. Just now, making this webpage took so much time and effort to execute!<br> it's small, but I believe all the elements put in this is simply a way of saying thank you to all the web developers of the world! <br>you guys are just amazing! Stress is one thing, but when you put all your heart, mind, and soul into a project, <br><br>it makes the most significant difference! Thank you so much, my dear coders! </p>
